Current program is too specific to my initial problem. It needs to be able to adapt. This could be done
through a function that determined, line by line, what the "format" should be. For example, differentiating
between:

What element is 'C'? Carbon.

Factors that led Luke to leave Tatooine.
	1. Message in R2-D2 for Obi-Wan
	2. Finding Obi-Wan
	3. Learning about his Father
	4. Aunt and Uncle killed by stromtroopers

Clearly, these both have terms and definitions, but are very different from each other in their appearence.
Not every possible input will be able to be reconciled, but a large majority should be able to be "understood"
and properly formatted in such a way that quizlet can be used to detect it.

#def determine_format(string, previous_return=""):
#    '''Determines the format of the string that is passed as input.
#       Returns:
#           "continue" - if there does not seem to be definition and a term
#           "question" - if there is a simple question (with a question mark)
#           and an answer.
#           "bullet, #" - if there is some sort of bulleted list (including
#           numbers), where # represents the number of list elements.'''
