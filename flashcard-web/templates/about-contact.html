    <p>My name is Lukas Richters. I am a second-year computer science major at Michigan State University. This site
        is hosted by Flask, using a Python module to perform the formatting. I'm always looking for fun new projects
        like this, so if you have any ideas to help alleviate my occasional boredom, let me know by contacting me with
        the information below. Lastly, if you work for Quizlet's legal team, please don't sue me, thanks.</p>

    <p>If you would like to report a bug or make a suggestion about this website, please don't hesitate to send me an
        email at lukasrichters14@gmail.com.</p>
