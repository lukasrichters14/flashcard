# flashcard

This is a website created in Python using Flask. The main functionality is for users to submit notes, which are then formatted so that they
can be easily used to create a Quizlet flashcard set. The site is not hosted yet, but with the addition of more robust parsing methods, the
site will be ready to put online.
